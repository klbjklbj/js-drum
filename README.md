# JS Drum Kit - Day 1

This is the Day 1 Activity for JavaScript30, the 30-Day Vanilla JavaScript Challenge by Wes Bos.  Users like me get to build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials using pure JS.

Helpful concepts covered in this challenge include:

* Data attributes - store extra info on standard HTML elements by using "data-*"
* www.keycode.info - helpful site that gives keycodes (numbers) for each key on keyboard
* [attribute] selectors - used to select elements with a specific attribute
* classList property - useful for adding and removing css classes on an element
* transitionend Event - occurs when a CSS transition has finished, animationend event is similar

On to Day 2...
